## 🎮 Introduction
Welcome to our **Universal Design Project**, built using **C#** and **MonoGame** as part of a game engine development module.  
This project explores engine architecture, 3D graphics rendering, asset pipelines, and real-time system design.  
The goal is to develop a basic game using the 3D engine we made in class throughout the semester.
