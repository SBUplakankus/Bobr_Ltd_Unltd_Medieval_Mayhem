# 🧩 Git & GitHub Workflow Guide

If you don't follow this and cause merge conflicts I will bully and take your lunch money

---

## 📌 Goals
- Avoid merge conflicts (especially in scenes, assets, and shared scripts)
- Keep the project stable at all times
- Ensure everyone works in their own safe space before merging
- Maintain clean commit history and readable changes

---

## 🌿 Main Branches
| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Stable, tested version of the project. **Do NOT push directly.** |
| `dev` | Active development branch. Features merge here after review. |

---

## 🗒️ **How to Use**
Every task, feature, or fix should be done on a **new branch based on `dev`**:
- This branch should have your name or initial in to indicate it is yours.
- Before you create a branch make sure you have fetched any updates from the dev branch.
- Correctly name all your commits and push each new thing you do, the more the better as it makes it easy to look back on.
- If you're having trouble ask Seán.
- Delete branches after merging (Theres a clear button on the website).
- DON'T TOUCH MAIN!!!!!!!!!
