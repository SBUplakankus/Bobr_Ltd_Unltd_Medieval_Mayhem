## 📌 Quick Tips

- Be careful when editing main, try to avoid it as much as possible to prevent conflicts. 
- Make sure all of our content is loaded into the dictonaries at the top of main. 
- To update the engine, copy over the **GDEngine** folder to the repo only.

## 🛠️ How-To Guides

### 🏠 Importing Models
Steps:

1. Open content.mcgb in Visual Studio
2. Click into Assets -> Models
3. With Models selected, click on Add Existing Item at the top *(Grey Box with Black Border and Green + Sign)*
4. Select the .fbx file
5. Click Build -> Build after it is successfully added
6. Re-open Visual Studio
7. Go to Content -> Assets -> Data and open `asset_manifest.json`
8. Create a new entry in the models section
9. Give it a name to be referenced by in the model dictionary
10. Insert the path to the model
11. Create through `multi_model_spawn.json` or individually in main

### 🖼️ Importing Textures
Steps:

1. Open content.mcgb in Visual Studio
2. Click into Assets -> Textures
3. With Textures selected, click on Add Existing Item at the top *(Grey Box with Black Border and Green + Sign)*
4. Select the texture file
5. Click Build -> Build after it is successfully added
6. Re-open Visual Studio
7. Go to Content -> Assets -> Data and open `asset_manifest.json`
8. Create a new entry in the textures section
9. Give it a name to be referenced by in the texture dictionary
10. Insert the path to the texture
11. When creating models, assign it this texture name

### 🔊 Importing Sounds
Steps:

1. Open content.mcgb in Visual Studio
2. Click into Assets -> Sounds
3. With Sounds selected, click on Add Existing Item at the top *(Grey Box with Black Border and Green + Sign)*
4. Select the sound file
5. In the properties panel, change import to `.wav` and processor to `sound effect`
6. Click Build -> Build after it is successfully added
7. Re-open Visual Studio
8. Go to Content -> Assets -> Data and open `asset_manifest.json`
9. Create a new entry in the sounds section
10. Give it a name to be referenced by in the sound dictionary
11. Insert the path to the sound 
12. When playing audio in the `AudioSystem`, pass through the name you gave it

### 👂 The Event Channel System
Steps:

1. All event scripts are stored in Scripts -> Events
2. There are seperate channels containing `EventBase` objects such as `InputEventChannel`
3. These are then created and accessed through the `EventChannelManager`
4. Each Event has `Subscribe()`, `Unsubscribe()` and `Raise()` functions
5. You pass through functions with the `Subscribe()` method which are all called with the `Raise()` method

   ```cs
   /// Referencing the Input Event Channel
   _inputEventChannel = EventChannelManager.Instance.InputEvents;

   /// Creating the Fullscreen Toggle function
   private void HandleFullscreenToggle() => _graphics.ToggleFullScreen();
   
   /// The Code for Subscribing
   _inputEventChannel.FullscreenToggle.Subscribe(HandleFullscreenToggle);

   /// The Code for Calling
   _inputEventChannel.FullscreenToggle.Raise();
   ```
   
6. The raise function will be called elsewhere, for example right now it is called through the `InputManager` class
7. It is important to unsubsribe methods when they are disabled.
8. Usually this is done in Unity through `OnDisable` but for our engine its in `Main.Dispose()`

## 📁 Project Workflow Notes

-  Engine is very basic, keep things simple.
-  Don't worry about lighting or animations at the moment.
-  Keep this updated as we progress.
